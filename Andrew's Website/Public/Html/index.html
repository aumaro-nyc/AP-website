      <h2>Osos Leatherworks</h2>
      <p class="content-paragraph">
        Andrew Peterson has a website. As a local Santa Fe leatherworker he primarily works with leather in
        Santa Fe New Mexico. You should let him make you some leather. He's also a real good lookin fella.
      </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">
        Here's another paragraph about Osos Leatherworks. Every piece is hand made right in Mad Dog Shipp's
        Trade Studio in the heart of downtown Santa Fe. Just make sure to tread lightly if you stop by because
        he's been known to shoot on sight and it's October and he's currently sober.
